# Next.js Project README

## Introduction

This README provides step-by-step instructions to install the necessary dependencies and run the project on **Windows**, **Mac**, and **Linux**.

---

## Prerequisites

### Before you start:
- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (version 16 or later is recommended).
- Install **npm**, which comes bundled with Node.js.

---

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

### Windows:
1. Download the Node.js installer from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure the option to install npm is checked.
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Mac:
1. Install Node.js via **Homebrew**:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```
2. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Linux:
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```
   Replace `16.x` with the desired version if necessary.
2. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Step 5: Build and Start for Production

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission Errors** (Linux/Mac): If you encounter issues with permissions, try running the command with `sudo`.
- **Port Already in Use**: If port 3000 is busy, specify a different port:
  ```bash
  PORT=4000 npm run dev
  ```

### Verify Node.js and npm:
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
